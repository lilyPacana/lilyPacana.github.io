				<b>Acoustic guitar:</b> <br> <br>
				An acoustic guitar is a guitar that produces sound acoustically by transmitting the vibration of the strings to the air—as opposed to relying on electronic amplification (see electric guitar).<br>
				The sound waves from the strings of an acoustic guitar resonate through the guitar's body, creating sound. This typically involves the use of a sound board and a sound box to strengthen the vibrations of the strings. <br>
				In standard tuning the guitar's six strings are tuned (low to high) E2 A2 D3 G3 B3 E4.
				The main source of sound in an acoustic guitar is the string, which is plucked or strummed with the finger or with a pick. <br>
				The string vibrates at a necessary frequency and also creates many harmonics at various different frequencies. The frequencies produced can depend on string length, mass, and tension. <br>
				The string causes the soundboard and sound box to vibrate, and as these have their own resonances at certain frequencies, they amplify some string harmonics more strongly than others, hence affecting the timbre produced by the instrument. <br>
				One of the best things about learning to play guitar is you can learn just a few chords and then be able to play hundreds of the best songs that were ever written. In this lesson, I’ll teach you four chords and ten songs you can play with those chords. For a more in-depth guide, check out these guitar lessons for beginners. <br><br>

				First, I’ll teach you the chords we’re going to use in this lesson. We’re going to use G major, C major, D major, and E minor.
				G Major Chord: Place your third finger on the third fret of the low E string, second finger on the second fret of the A string, and your fourth finger on the third fret of the high E string. For the G major chord, you can strum all six strings.
				Chord Tip: One thing to remember when you’re making chords is to come right down on the tips of your fingers and to place your fingers right behind the frets. This will help you get a clean sound without any buzzing.
				first fret of the B string. For the C major chord, strum just the top five strings, leaving the low E out. <br>
				Be sure to use the tips of your fingers for this chord, or you’ll get a buzzy, unclear sound. In the video, you can see that if I am lazy with my fingers at all, the chord doesn’t sound very good.
				D Major Chord: Place your first finger on the second fret of the G string, third finger on the third fret of the B string, and second finger on the second fret of the high E string. For the D major chord, leave the low E and A strings out, strumming just the top four strings.
				E Minor Chord: Place your second finger on the second fret of the A string and your third finger on the second fret of the D string. For this chord, you can strum all six strings again.

				<b>Guitar Chord Charts & Finger Positions:</b> <br> <br>
				By learning how to play chord progressions, you will find it easy to learn to play many popular songs. A chord progression is just a sequence of chords, usually three or four, that is repeated throughout a song. The easy guitar chords in the chart below are commonly used in the progressions that make up many popular songs:
				<img src="images/picture1.png">
				For the first chord progression you will learn, you’ll want to start by learning how to play a C chord on guitar. Put your index finger on your left hand on the first fret of the B string. Place your middle finger on the second fret of the D string, and your ring finger on the third fret of the A string. Press firmly with the tips of your fingers and be sure not to accidentally mute any other strings. <br> Strum slowly from the A string down and listen to the chord ring.
				Next, you will need to learn to play the G chord. Place your index finger on the second fret of the A string and your middle finger on the third fret of the low E string. Place your ring finger on the third fret of the high E string. Strum from the E string all the way down.
				The last chord you will need to know for this progression is the D chord. Place your index finger on the second fret of the G string and your middle finger on the second fret of the high e string. Your ring finger goes on the third fret of the B string. Strum this chord from your D string down.

				<b>Why I love playing the guitar :</b> <br> <br>
				When I was a young teenager I fell in love with the guitar.  It was it's symmetric shape at first that drew me closer.  The guitar has a wonderful shape and size.  It felt great in the hands and the woods used in it's construction where warm and always smelled of roses.  It was around this time that I first heard it played by a master and another miracle was revealed, the guitar could produce more than one melody at a time.  In musical language this is called polyphony, many voices.  It was a very important discovery for me because I knew at that point in time that  I would try to make a life with the guitar. <br><br>

				There is a particular quality to the sound of a plucked string.  In listening to recordings I was struck by the very human quality of the tones.  The strings sounded like voices from a choir.  Tone, the color of the sound, is a quality of the guitar that keeps me listening and practicing.  I have continued to work for 30 years to produce my best sound.  I have to practice every day to hear what a great sound could feel like. <br><br>

				There is another attractive feature of the guitar, it's mobility.  I could take my guitar anywhere. I put it in it's case and took it with me so that I never had to worry about being apart from It.  This was so important for me because I moved a lot when I was young and I grew up in a boarding school where my guitar was a very needed and familiar friend.  The guitar gave me an opportunity to build a landscape of sound that I could visit every time I picked it up.  A world of music, pieces of art from as far back as 600 years.  This was a very important connection I had with practice and the masters of the guitar's history. <br><br>

				The guitar is an instrument that fits me particularly well because it is a very individualistic instrument.  An instrument that can be played in many different ways and reveals the personality of the person playing it.  The fact that the music is created with hands on the strings makes this possible.  There is nothing in between the hands and and the music. <br><br>

				Finally, there is the love of music itself.  An instrument is only a means to enter the world of music.  It is music itself that has kept me working to get better as a player.  Music gave me something to concentrate on when I could not concentrate.  It gave me a purpose when I felt none.  Music gave me hope for the future when I felt I was going nowhere.  The work of the  guitar taught me what can be achieved with daily practice.  There was no other subject that did this for me while I was growing up.  Even today the guitar still challenges me to no end.  I still have to work hard to create and the next level of skill is always in the future after daily work. <br><br>

				Today I get to show others how to create their own world of music to inhabit.  I am in a very privileged place where I am blessed with the work of introducing this miracle of sound, the process of practice and improvement.  It is in teaching also that the  magic of the guitar is revealed through the spark and fires of inspiration that emerge from my students.  My students help show me why I love the guitar.
